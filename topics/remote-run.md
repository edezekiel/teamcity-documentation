[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Remote Run)

A _remote run_ is a [personal build](personal-build.md) initiated by a developer from one of the supported IDE plugins to test how the changes will integrate into the project's code base. Unlike [Pre-tested (delayed) commit](pre-tested-delayed-commit.md), no code is checked into the VCS regardless of the state of the personal build initiated via Remote Run.

For a list of version control systems supported by each IDE, see [Supported Platforms and Environments](supported-platforms-and-environments.md).
